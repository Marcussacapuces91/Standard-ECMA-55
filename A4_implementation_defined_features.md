# Appendix 4
# Implementation-defined Features

A number of the features defined in this Standard have been left for definition by the implementor. However, this will not affect portability, provided that the limits recommended in the various sections are respected. The way these features are implemented shall be defined in the user- or system-manual of the specific implementation. 

The following is a list of implementation-defined features: 

- accuracy of evaluation of numeric expressions (see 8) 
- end-of-line (see 5, 14 and 15) 
- exrad-width for printing numeric representations (see 14) 
- initial value of variables (see 7) 
- input-prompt (see 15) 
- longest string that can be retained (see 11) 
- value of machine infinitesimal (see 6) 
- value of machine infinity (see 6) 
- margin for output lines (see 14) 
- precision for numeric values (see 6) 
- print-zone length (see 14) 
- pseudo-random number sequence (see 9 and 20) 
- significance width for printing numeric representations (see 15) 
- means of requesting the input-reply in batch mode (see 15)
